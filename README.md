# Roadmap

Rodash is intended to serve as a standard library for core functionality that Lua is lacking, similar to those found in Typescript and Rust.

As such, the aim of development is to maintain existing functionality and add standalone helper functions over time, but to avoid adding larger components that would be better suited in a standalone library.

Examples of ideas for future releases include:
* Math functions (i.e. `round`, `equalWithin`, `withPrecision` etc.)
* More array operations (i.e. `sumBy`, `maxOf` etc.)
* `deserialize`

Examples of library functions which would be better suited to other libraries:
* Roblox instance management
* Color manipulation
* Advanced logging tools
* Translation tools
* Parsing / lexing tools

If you have any feature requests, please get in touch!
